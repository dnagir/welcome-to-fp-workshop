# Preparation for the workshop

Please bring your laptop with the following software pre-installed to the workshop.

## macOS

If you are on macOS Mojave (10.14) or High Sierra (10.13), please [download Haskell for Mac](http://download.haskellformac.com/) and activate the 14 day trial. Haskell for Mac is an IDE that makes it easy to get started with Haskell. You will receive a full license key at the workshop.

For High Sierra, please use the [old version of Haskell for Mac](https://dl.devmate.com/com.haskellformac.Haskell.basic/1482/1545510880/Haskellâ€”FunctionalProgrammingLab-1482.dmg) for now.

If you are on a version of macOS older than 10.13, please [install the Haskell Platform (8.6.3)](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.6.3/Haskell%20Platform%208.6.3%20Core%2064bit-signed.pkg) package. This provides you with a command line compiler.

## Windows

Please [install the Haskell Platform (8.6.3)](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.6.3/HaskellPlatform-8.6.3-core-x86_64-setup.exe). (There is also a [32bit version](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.6.3/HaskellPlatform-8.6.3-core-i386-setup.exe).) Also, please take not of these [additional instructions](https://www.haskell.org/platform/#windows).

## Linux

On Linux, please use the package manager of your Linux distribution as described on the [Haskell Platform page](https://www.haskell.org/platform/#linux). Please install the version including version 8.6.4 or 8.6.3 of GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

## Editor support (optional)

Here are some *optional* suggestions for improved Haskell support in a variety of editors. You will be able to follow the workshop without installing any of these.

* **Haskell for Mac:** Nothing to do: a Haskell editor is built-in. 
* **Emacs:** [haskell-mode](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/)
* **Vim:** [haskell-vim](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/haskell-vim)
* **Sublime:** [SublimeHaskell](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeHaskell)
* **Atom:** [Atom-Haskell](https://atom-haskell.github.io)
